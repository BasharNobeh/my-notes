Softwares are made to help people and when a software conceive the purpose of making it then its calles a good software.
Its not all about how it works but the software design is as important as main aim of it and that's why every programmer is a designer too.
Most of the times softwares can suffer because of misunderstanding which can cost money and time and even more . <br>
**when deveolping a system it should not be perfect in every way
as it should be :**
>- **Reliable**
>- **Easy to maintaine**
>- **Good infrastructure**
>- **Versatile**
>- **Achives the scope** 

Working in a team can help a lot when its all about developing and coding so asking for help instead of being a hero can help a lot but at the same time you have to depend on yourself 
and develop your skills in life and coding . one of those skills is explainning your code by using comments which will help others a lot and will make understanding your code much eaiser .
**Here is a short summary about The Five Elements of the Developer Mindset from my point of view :**
>- **Learn to buckle and not stop until the work is done.**
>- **Learn to love pain. Or at least not fight.**
>- **Remember why you are doing something**
>- **Remember that everyone needs help. High in!** 
>- **Don't forget the fun. Don't forget the playfulness!**
